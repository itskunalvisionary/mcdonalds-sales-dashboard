🍔 McDonald’s Sales & Operations Performance Dashboard (Excel Data Analytics Project)
📈 Project Overview
This Excel Data Analytics project simulates a real-world business scenario where I, as a Data Analyst Intern, worked on analyzing McDonald’s India and Global Markets sales data to uncover actionable business insights and optimize operational performance.
